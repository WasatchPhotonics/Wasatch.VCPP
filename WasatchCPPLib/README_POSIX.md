# Overview

This directory is a placeholder for a future WasatchCPPLib -- no "V", hence no 
"Visual Studio" -- targetting Linux, MinGW, MacOS etc on a gcc / clang toolchain.  

It would share the majority of its source code with the Visual C++ side, and 
ideally represent nothing but a Makefile (or Automake) framework defining
platform-specific macros and generating the build products accordingly.
